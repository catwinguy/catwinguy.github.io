			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Hello! My name is Catherine Nguyen, and I'm a fourth-year Computer Engineering major student at Drexel University.
				Although my major has lots of aspects in the hardware component of computer-related topics,
				my focus is mainly on the software side of computer engineering. 

				Web developement and computer architecture are my current interests, but
				I also want to explore other specialization topics. My current goal is to improve my 
				JavaScript and Python skills while working on interesting projects, like the Discord Bot detailed below.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Based on the classes I took, I am very interested in computer architecture and networks. While I haven't had
				real hands-on experience working with networks yet, I think I have a good understanding of the basics of computer
				architecture since one of the projects I completed was simulating RISC-V's pipeline microarchitecture with C.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				I love to read! If I have some free time, you will find me on my phone reading something online.
				Sometimes, I'll read the news and other times, I'll be reading an online web novel.
				Although I haven't read a physical book in a long while, I still like to browse bookstores
				to see any new interesting releases and ponder the moment of when I'll read the philosophy books I
				have on my shelf.
			</p>
			<br>
			<!-- <p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A new hobby I've picked up is drawing. Art has always been an on and off passion that never really
				developed. Now that I got an iPad (mainly to help me study), I find it easier and more convenient
				to create some sketches to hopefully improve my drawing skills.
			</p>

			<h1>Current Project: <span style="color: lightpink;">Discord Bot</span></h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> Bot is a tool that can maximize productivity in one's Discord server and provide
				fun activities that users can interact with. My Discord Bot (name to be decided) will have two main functions:
				(1) voice channel connectivity/activity and (2) MMORPG text adventure game-like interactions. Funny thing is that
				an RPG Bot already exists, so I have to brainstorm new game mechanics and game content to make my bot unique.
